# Dokku

## What is Dokku

Dokku is a very simple but powerfull PaaS implementation Ã -la Heroku that you can run in minutes on your own host.

## What it's not

Let's quote the project's readme:

### Things this project won't do

* Multi-host. Not a huge leap, but this isn't the project for it. Have a look at Flynn.
* Multitenancy. It's ready for it, but again, have a look at Flynn.
* Client app. Given the constraints, running commands remotely via SSH is fine.
